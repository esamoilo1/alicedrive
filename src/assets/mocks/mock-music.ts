`Right In My Head

1

I can’t sleep tonight
I just feel it inside
Like ten thousand knives
Cleave my brain, oh!
What’s going on?
Could I do something wrong?
I believe my shotgun
Was a vengeance sword

First time is the hardest one
I did what must be done

Chorus

I know they all died (Long time!)
Long time (Ago!)
And fell from the skies
I know we’re all shocked (Enough!)
Of their crime (What for?)
So why do I hear tonight their calling
When I close my eyes
Everything I have
The voices jar loud
Right in my head!

2

Affluent sons
Thought the money helps out
Get away any crime
Raped that girl
No one could help
So I did it myself
Just a couple of bangs
Rights a wrong

I know the law can’t reach them all
So I have my own

I

Don’t say you call me back to love me
You stuck needles in my skin
What I knew, what I thought
The time willl never erase it
Don’t waste you time defiling on me
You have always been right here
The lights grow dark
Help me, I’m dying

Have you ever thought this moment
Comes to be you dream?
Have never thought about it
Yet?

Chorus

Oh, I don’t want you back, my destiny
Comes into my heart
I know you miss me
When the night is falling
No, I don’t want you to call me destiny
I opened my eyes
My dreams come true.

II

Don’t say you know what inside me
That is burning me again
My obsession came back strong
And there’s nobody to stop this
Let us find our way
We believed that we have done it
This life is a game – so play

Let me fall into your grace
Disappear without a trace
Let me go, let me go, let me go…

Wanna see you come home

Look at me with disdain

It’s gonna hurt
You badly

Everything is gone
And my heart is down
I can’t stand more
Dying off aloud
Make myself slow
Getting off this town
I dared to say NO
I wanna let me by

You gotta let me by!
Bye! Bye!

It brings me far from you

1
It’s like standing under gunfire
It’s like walking a last mile
I see the crowd around
It’s yelling I’m blunt
I’m not listening

I used to stand for long
But today is when I go
You never find it hard
To stay forever young
And not fade away

Now I know
Who I am
It grants me freedom
But it means without you
Just nothing at all
So I’m going home

Chorus
Never wanna lose you in my dreams
All the years and miles along 
You hide away
Somewhere I can’t go
Never gonna promise you to leave
You are still my number one
I’ll find a way (find a way),
Find a way (find a way),
Find a way 
You are somewhere, I know

II
But minutes are so slow
Ten hundred miles per hour
I feel it’s not enough
To reach you again
It’s like standing under gunfire
But I’ll try to keep that smile
Let no one ever knows
You are my last resort
You’re everything

Now I know
Who I am
It grants me freedom
But it means without you
Just nothing at all
So I’m going home

I’m lost without you
I’m dying without you
You know I love you so
I dream about it
I scream about it
To never let you go!

Desolate, demoralized, banged up to the eyes – oh!
Didn’t even realize lake of shit I used to dive slow
Cry, cry, cry, I don’t wanna cry anymore
I wasted much on pity to myself
Now I’m waking out of trance
I’m not afraid to stick my neck out
Damp passed away

This is my story
How can that be
My little world
Is burnt to the ground
Just hungover mornings
Make me feel
Alive

Off the road
Thrown aside
I said I’m not on it
Anymore
But I’m back tonight

With your face all in a muck, with the fingers torn to blood - go!
When you’re even washed out, you’re not out and about – go!
I d-d-d-d don’t regret what I haven’t done and become
I wasted much on pity to myself
Now I’m waking out of trance
I’m gonna strain every nerve
For all these things
That I believe in!

I know this is a burnout
But I will try it once again
